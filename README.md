# OLA Data Analyst Project

## Project Overview
The OLA Data Analyst Project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing ride-hailing data using SQL and Power BI. This project includes SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis, a Power BI .pbix file for visualization, and a detailed PDF report explaining the project's context, questions, and answers.

### Key Resources Included:
1. **SQL Queries**: A set of SQL scripts for various analytical tasks.
2. **Power BI File**: A .pbix file containing interactive dashboards.
3. **PDF Report**: A detailed project document outlining objectives, methodologies, and results.

## Analytical Goals

### SQL Queries:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings.
2. Calculate the average ride distance for each vehicle type.
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers.
4. Identify the top 5 customers by the number of rides booked.
5. Count rides cancelled by drivers for personal and car-related issues.
6. Determine the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings.
7. Retrieve all rides paid via UPI.
8. Calculate the average customer rating per vehicle type.
9. Compute the total booking value for successful rides.
10. List incomplete rides along with their reasons.

### Power BI Dashboards:
1. **Overall Analysis**:
   - Ride Volume Over Time
   - Booking Status Breakdown
2. **Vehicle Analysis**:
   - Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance
   - Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type
3. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - Revenue by Payment Method
   - Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value
   - Ride Distance Distribution Per Day
4. **Cancellations**:
   - Reasons for Cancellations (Customer and Driver)
5. **Ratings**:
   - Driver Ratings Distribution
   - Customer vs. Driver Ratings
